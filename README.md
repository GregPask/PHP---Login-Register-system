# PHP---Login-Register-system



A login/Register app I made using PHP.



A user is prompted to Register.

One finishing they are provded a randomly generated password (sent to their email inbox).

The user needs to enter this verification code into the Login page.

If successful the user will be granted access to the webpage.



Tested the email functionality on web server and it all works yayy!
